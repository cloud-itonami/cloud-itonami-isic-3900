  "The governor contract as executable end-to-end tests, driven
  through the full langgraph-clj `remediationops.operation` StateGraph
  (intake -> advise -> govern -> decide -> commit | hold |
  request-approval). The single invariant under test:

    RemediationOpsAdvisor never commits a proposal the
    SiteRemediationOpsGovernor would reject,
    `:flag-contamination-concern` ALWAYS interrupts for human sign-off
    (never auto, at any phase), and every decision (commit OR hold)
